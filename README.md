# image-to-text-converter
An image-to-text converter in Python uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images. The pytesseract library (a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine) and the Pillow library for image processing are typically used. After installing these libraries and Tesseract-OCR, you can load an image with Pillow and extract the text with pytesseract
